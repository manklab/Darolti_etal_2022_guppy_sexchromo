#Coverage Analysis Steps (method adapted from Bergero et al. 2019 PNAS):
#Note: All genome fasta files are in the folder "genomes" and all sample fastq files are in the folder "reads".
#Note: Names of fastq files are of the format "sample_R1.fastq" or "sample_R2.fastq"

# 1. Align reads to each genome using BWA

#Create genome index with BWA
for genome in ./genomes/*.fa; do 
    echo "bwa index $genome"
    bwa index $genome
done

#Map reads to genome with BWA. For each sample and genome assembly separately run:
bwa-mapper.sh sample_R1.fastq sample_R2.fastq genome.fa

#Sort files
for file in ./reads/*_mem.sam; do 
	echo "samtools sort -O bam -T ${file%.*}.sort -o ${file%.*}_sort.bam $file"
	samtools sort -O bam -T ${file%.*}.sort -o ${file%.*}_sort.bam $file
done


# 2. Remove duplicates using Picard Tools
for file in ./reads/*_mem_sort.bam; do 
	echo "java -jar /Linux/picard-tools-2.0.1/picard.jar MarkDuplicates I=$file O=${file%.*}_rmdup.bam M=${file%.*}_dupmetrics.txt REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=2000"
	java -jar /Linux/picard-tools-2.0.1/picard.jar MarkDuplicates I=$file O=${file%.*}_rmdup.bam M=${file%.*}_dupmetrics.txt REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=2000
	samtools index ${file%.*}_rmdup.bam
done


# 3. Estimate coverage in 50kb windows

#Run samtools depth
for file in ./reads/*_mem_sort_rmdup.bam; do 
    echo "samtools depth -a $file > ${file%.*}_samdepth.txt"
    samtools depth -a $file > ${file%.*}_samdepth.txt
done

#Split rmdup.bam files into separate chromosomes for each sample
cd ./reads
for file in *_mem_sort_rmdup_samdepth.txt; do
    name=$(basename "$file" | awk -F _mem '{print $1}')
    mkdir "$name"
    cd "$name"
    echo "awk 'NR!=1 {print >$1".txt"}' ../$file"
    awk 'NR!=1 {print >$1".txt"}' ../$file
    cd ../
done

#Get average coverage per 50kb windows and then concatenate all chromosomes into a single file
#Note: For the P. wingei analyses that used the P. wingei de novo assembly windows of 10kb were used instead.
python2 get_coverage_50kb_windows.py ./reads/
python2 concatenate_chromosomes.py ./reads


# 4. Calculate and plot male:female coverage fold change

#normalize coverage values: run normalize_coverage.R script
#move normalized coverage files into separate male and female folders (do this for each analysis that used a different genome)

#extract average coverage for each sex
python2 extract_coverage.py ./females_folder coverage_females.txt
python2 extract_coverage.py ./males_folder coverage_males.txt

#calculate coverage fold change
python2 coverage_fold_change.py coverage_females.txt coverage_males.txt coverage_fold_change.txt

#for analyses that used the X. maculatus or P. reticulata reference genomes and additional step is required to account for inversions on the X chromosome
python2 inversion_Xmac.py coverage_fold_change.txt coverage_fold_change_inversion.txt
python2 inversion_Pret.py coverage_fold_change.txt coverage_fold_change_inversion.txt

#moving average plot: run plot_coverage.R
