#Coverage Analysis Steps (method adapted from Wright et al. 2017 NatCommun):
#Note: All genome fasta files are in the folder "genomes" and all sample fastq files are in the folder "reads".
#Note: Names of fastq files are of the format "sample_R1.fastq" or "sample_R2.fastq"

# 1. Align reads to each genome using BWA (aln/sampe) and select uniquely mapping reads

#Create genome index with BWA
for genome in ./genomes/*.fa; do 
	echo "bwa index $genome"
	bwa index $genome
done

#Create suffix array indices for each sample
for genome in ./genomes/*.fa; do 
	fname=$(basename "$genome" | awk -F'[_]' '{print $1}')
	for fastq in ./reads/*.fastq; do 
		echo "bwa aln -t 12 $genome $fastq > ${fastq%.*}_${fname}.sai" 
		bwa aln -t 12 $genome $fastq > ${fastq%.*}_${fname}.sai
	done
done

#Generate alignments
python2 bwa_sampe.py ./genomes/ ./reads/

#Select uniquely mapping reads
for file in ./reads/*_sampe.sam; do 
	echo "grep 'XT:A:U' $file > ${file%.*}_uniq.sam" 
	grep 'XT:A:U' $file > ${file%.*}_uniq.sam 
done


# 2. Estimate coverage in 50kb windows using SOAP.coverage
python2 soap_coverage.py ./genomes/ ./reads/


# 3. Calculate and plot male:female coverage fold change

#normalize coverage values: run normalize_coverage.R script
#move normalized coverage files into separate male and female folders (do this for each analysis that used a different genome)

#extract average coverage for each sex
python2 extract_coverage.py ./females_folder coverage_females.txt
python2 extract_coverage.py ./males_folder coverage_males.txt

#calculate coverage fold change
python2 coverage_fold_change.py coverage_females.txt coverage_males.txt coverage_fold_change.txt

#for analyses that used the X. maculatus or P. reticulata reference genomes and additional step is required to account for inversions on the X chromosome
python2 inversion_Xmac.py coverage_fold_change.txt coverage_fold_change_inversion.txt
python2 inversion_Pret.py coverage_fold_change.txt coverage_fold_change_inversion.txt

#moving average plot: run plot_coverage.R
